## Tea-Subscription API Service
This BE API is intended for the simple usage of managing tea subscriptions for customers. There are only a few models including the customer, subscription, and tea, that are tied together with a many-to-many relationship model of subscription_tea. 

- Customers are able to subscribe to a tea subscription which would create a custom subscription for that customer with a status on whether it is active or cancelled
- Teas are able to be added to the subscriptions, thus creating subscription_tea objects
